I think you mean *team*…
I think you mean *all*…
I think you mean *pals*…
I think you mean *gang*…
I think you mean *crew*…
I think you mean *people*…
I think you mean *y'all*…
I think you mean *everyone*…
I think you mean *folk*…
I think you mean *fellow humans*...
Have you considered a more gender-neutral pronoun like *team*?
Have you considered using a different pronoun instead of *guys*? Because many here (including me) aren't guys?
